// Omar: this is not to be used anywhere, just my way of cataloging which sites work and what common badges they possess that is currently populated on the seedDB.js - in other words they have more 'badges' on the API res but these are the ones that i've populated on the seed file.

sites = [
    {
        "yelp.com": "Google Analytics, Nginx, jQuery, React"
    },
    {
        "mlb.com": "Nginx, Twitter, jQuery"
    },
    {
        "homedepot.com": "Bootstrap, Nginx, jQuery"
    },
    {
        "columbia.edu": "AngularJS, Google Analytics, Apache"
    },
    {}, {}

]
