# SiteChecker

## Description
Sitechecker is a platform that scrapes and verifies site-specific elements, functionality, issues and many more relevant web metrics.

The ambition behind Sitechecker is to encourage our users to test their websites and receive a score and badges for any metrics that Sitechecker currently checks for.

Our users may add a meta tag to their sites to “claim” a site and it will be added to their profile along with the badges and a tally of scores.  It can be used on their linkedin profile and even serve as a portfolio.
