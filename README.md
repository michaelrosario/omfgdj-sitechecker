# SiteChecker

## Description
Sitechecker is a platform that scrapes and verifies site-specific elements, functionality, issues and many more relevant web metrics.

The ambition behind Sitechecker is to encourage our users to test their websites and receive a score and badges for any metrics that Sitechecker currently checks for.

Our users may add a meta tag to their sites to “claim” a site and it will be added to their profile along with the badges and a tally of scores.  It can be used on their linkedin profile and even serve as a portfolio.

## User Stories
1. Users navigates to Sitechecker and searches for his website.
2. Users can register with Sitechecker and claim/save a website to their profile for later viewing
2a. Registered users can also view current badges of websites they have claimed and share them with other Users.
